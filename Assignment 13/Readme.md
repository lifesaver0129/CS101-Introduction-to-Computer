**Please Design a software**

1. Please briefly describe the function of the software and the problems it solves. 

   **Function**: The students can upload their feedback about SUSTech courses, mainly in the following area: the difficulty of course, the usefulness of the course, the responsible level of teacher, and the tendency of getting higher score. Those points states different aspects of a course, and by digitizing those area we, the student can easily find whether a course is worth or not. As a system (website and mobile application) oriented to on campus student, this could only recoginze student email to make sure everything on it is only open to SUSTech student to avoid outside voices. Student will receive credit after they submit the accurate result of the courses.

   **Problems it solves**: Although currently there are some judge system available like grading the profermonce to teachers and courses after every semaster, those data is not open to next year students so the student don't know whether a course is time needed or research based. I aim to provide the information about a course to students. 

2. What name would you give this software? 

   **Course Grader**.
